# Strengths and Weaknesses

## Strengths

Version control: Git keeps track of changes made to files over time and makes it easy to go back to previous versions to understand the progress of the project. It offers features such as branching and merging, allowing efficient work on multiple branches of code simultaneously.

Collaboration and teamwork: Git supports concurrent development by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. It provides mechanisms for merging changes from different branches and resolving conflicts that can arise during collaboration.

## Weaknesses

Learning Curve: Git has a steep learning curve, especially for users who are new to version control systems. Understanding Git's concepts, commands, and workflows takes some time and effort, which can be challenging for beginners.

File size and storage: Git stores a complete copy of the repository locally, including all historical data. As a result, storage requirements can increase over time. This is especially true for projects with large histories or large binaries and PDFs, since Git stores the entire documents each time, not just the changes.
